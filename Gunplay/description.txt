Terraria Gunplay

The Gunplay Mod seeks to add numerous amounts of new guns and customization options to the player.
You are able to mix and match parts into different gun types with different stats and functions.
Parts can be obtained through a number of ways, whether it be through defeating bosses or just simply buying them.
You can also upgrade your guns with tech obtained in Hardmode.
